## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?  
* vehicle lenth and ground clearance provide non-random amount of variance and show significance on mpg  
  
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?  
* no, theres a significant linear relatioship  
  
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?  
* yes, vehicle lenth and ground clearance are signifiancr to mpg

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils  
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?  
* Total summary shows variance of 62.29356 whcih is within the required 100 PSI variance. The individual summaries show that Lot 3 is showng a much larger variance, 170.28612.
